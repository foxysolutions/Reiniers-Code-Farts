A nice Repository to store all crazy thoughts and lovely snippets to make the world a better (and more optimal) place!

## Python

* [JSON Parser](python/JsonParser.py) - fun little project to validate and transform a JSON String to Python data types
* [Media File Prefixer](python/MediaFilePrefixer.py) - allows to prefix images based on created date (and set CreatedDate to the DateTaken when copied), such the images are always shown in correct order when sorted by Name (cross-system, e.g. STACK)

## VBA (Outlook Add-in)

* [EmailVitality](vba/outlook-addins) - Outlook Add-in to prompt user when email is tried to be send outside Working hours. Suggestion is to delay email till start of next workingday.
